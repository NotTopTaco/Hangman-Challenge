# Hangman-Challenge
This is the hangman challenge. I added input verification. It is to be run in the terminal. 
I just barely got the challenge email on December 9th and was able to squeeze it in between prepping for finals. It took me just one and a half hours. 
It was created in C++ and can be run in any standard IDE.
